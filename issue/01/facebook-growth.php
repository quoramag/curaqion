				<p>This question suggests it wants to know the exact, tactical decisions. As much as I would like to share those tactics in great detail because it's fascinating and readers of this question would find it interesting/valuable, I'm legally bound to a certain amount of confidentiality so I'll only go as detailed as I'm legally able to. That basically means I won't share numbers and I won't comment on things that aren't directly discernable to the general public. Also, the list of optimizations is too long for anyone to remember. I also didn't work on the majority of those optimizations directly but tended to learn about them via close proximity to the people solving the problem they were assigned to solve. The team grew to 30 - 40 people so most of my day-to-day work was contained to a subset of the optimizations that were taking place at any given moment.</p>
				<p>There are a few different types of "decisions" though. There are decisions around tactics, decisions around strategy, decisions around hiring, and decisions around priorities and culture. The growth team participated in decisions across all types and all are critical to a growth team.</p>

				<h2>Tactics</h2>
				<p>There are too many to name but most come down to internet marketing 101: test, optimize, rinse and repeat. If you want a list of methods for testing and optimizing various parts of a product or referring channel, then read my answer to What are some top strategies for conversion optimization? You can pretty much guarantee that just about every one of these strategies was applied in one way or another to various parts of Facebook's product. But again, I can't share specifics that aren't obvious, public domain nor can I share stats. Nor can I speak to the complete level of depth and complexity that the entire team went into to fine tune the parts of the product that enabled growth to happen. Some tactics I also don't want to share because they were so damn effective.</p>

				<h2>Hiring</h2>
				<p>Who was hired to work on growth was arguably the most important decision being made. The team was led by Chamath Palihapitiya:</p>
				<p>He is by far the best person I have ever worked for/with. He is deeply analytical, rigorously focused on success (or as he would say, "crushing it!"), gifted as a natural leader and motivator, aggressive and unafraid of taking risk, and knows consumer tech at a black belt level. He was the backbone of the growth team and making him the head of growth was a brilliant decision. I remember in my first week on the job I went to lunch with him to get to know him a bit more. It was a formality that all new hires went through. Pretty standard stuff. The conversation we had was far from standard though. I remember asking him, "So what kind of users am I going after? Any particular demographics or regions? Does it matter?" and he sternly responded "It's fucking land-grab time so get all of the fucking land you can get." In other words, don't ask such a stupid question next time. Get the entire planet on Facebook. Clear enough, right!? I knew I liked him from the start.</p>

				<p>He went on to bring others onto the team like Blake Ross, Alex Schultz, Javier Olivan and several other really talented people spanning the spectrum of skills from direct acquisition marketing (SEO, PPC, email, a/b testing, merchandising, link building) to deeply technical back end and front end engineers, designers, and data scientists.</p>

				<p>Javier Olivan is responsible for building and scaling the international growth side of the team. He helped build the internationalization team that consisted of engineers who built the translations application that allowed our own users to translate Facebook for us. This video that explains the process always pulls at my heart strings (unfortunately it isn't embeddable so you'll have to click the link):</p>

				<p>Perhaps the greatest lever in getting to 500M or more users was making the site available in virtually every language on the planet. As Nico Vera stated in the video, language localization is the "great equalizer". It made Facebook a platform capable of supporting everyone on the planet. I believe Facebook is available in 80 languages now. That became possible because engineers on the growth team built a tool that allowed the users to crowd source translation of the site for us. Growth was not about hiring 10 people per country and putting them in the 20 most important countries and expecting it to grow. Growth was about engineer systems of scale and enabling our users to grow the product for us.</p>

				<h2>Strategy</h2>

				<p>You can think about strategy a few ways. One way is in how we generically framed growth funnels and how that tended to inform growth roadmaps. For example, you could say that growth is broken down into a few fundamental questions:</p>
				<ol>
    				<li>How do I increase the rate of acquisition i.e. get more signups?</li>
    				<li>What can I do to activate as many users as quickly as possible in their first 'N' days?</li>
    				<li>What are the levers for engagement and retention and how can I pull them?</li>
    				<li>How do I bring churned users back into the system to "resurrect" them from the dead? </li>
    			</ol>

    			<p>From those question you can go down the path of identifying products that impact a certain metric (e.g. what products help drive acquisition?) and then figure out how to either (1) optimize those channels to produce more value OR (2) build new acquisition channels from scratch to add more acquisition volume. For example, here is a list of things that could take part in the acquisition funnel:
